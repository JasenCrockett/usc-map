        "description": "In 1849, journalist-historian Benson Lossing traveled to the Scruggs farm seeking information about the Cowpens battle. Using the house as a point of reference, he located fields \"within a quarter mile of the Scruggs\" where the battle raged more than half a century before. Journalist Lossing noted that the battlefield presented \"a most dreary appearance.\" Ax and plow had turned an open hardwood forest into stumps, pine thickets and cornfields.",
